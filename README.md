# Rocksdb-example

This is just a simple exercise to get more confident on using databases. In this particular case I use `rocksdb`.

## Rocksdb

`Rocksdb` is a popular key-value database invented by Facebook.

## Notes list

This example is a simple CLI program that let a user creates some text notes and saves them in a database.

Then the user can retrieves them or delete them. Very simple stuff by the way.
